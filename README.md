# Exoplanet Data Dashboard

This project is an interactive dashboard for exploring various properties of exoplanets and their host stars. The dashboard is built using Streamlit, Plotly, and Astroquery to fetch and visualize data from the NASA Exoplanet Archive.

## Features

- **Data Retrieval**: Fetches exoplanet data from the NASA Exoplanet Archive using Astroquery.
- **Filtering**: Allows users to filter the dataset based on discovery method, distance to star, and planetary mass.
- **Visualizations**: Provides multiple visualization options including:
    - Discovery method distribution pie chart
    - Planetary mass distribution histogram
    - Radius vs. orbital period scatter plot
    - Transit depth vs. duration scatter plot
    - Stellar temperature vs. luminosity scatter plot
    - Custom scatter plots
