Here’s a deeper explanation of selected column names from the given dataset.

---

### **General Information**
- **pl_name**: The name of the exoplanet. Typically, planets are named after their host star followed by a letter (e.g., "Kepler-22b").
- **hostname**: Name of the host star that the planet orbits. The host star may have multiple planets orbiting it.
- **tic_id, gaia_id**: Unique identifiers for the star or system from the TESS Input Catalog (TIC) or Gaia database, useful for cross-referencing datasets.

---

### **Discovery Information**
- **discoverymethod**: Method used to discover the planet. Common methods include:
  - **Transit**: Monitoring the dip in starlight when a planet passes in front of its host star.
  - **Radial Velocity**: Detecting the wobble of the star due to the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet.
  - **Direct Imaging**: Observing the planet directly.
  - **Microlensing**: Detecting gravitational lensing caused by a planet-star system.
  - **Timing Variations**: Observing variations in periodic events like pulsar signals.

- **disc_year**: The year the discovery was officially published. 
- **disc_locale, disc_facility**: The physical location or observatory where the discovery was made, such as "Hubble Space Telescope" or "Keck Observatory."
- **disc_instrument, disc_telescope**: Specific instruments or telescopes used for detection.

### **Orbital Parameters**
- **pl_orbper**: The time a planet takes to complete one orbit around its star, expressed in Earth days.
- **pl_orbeccen**: Orbital eccentricity, which measures how elliptical (as opposed to circular) the orbit is. A value of 0 indicates a perfect circle.
- **pl_orbsmax**: The semi-major axis of the orbit, or the average distance between the planet and its star, typically expressed in astronomical units (AU).
- **pl_orbincl**: Orbital inclination in degrees, measuring the tilt of the orbit relative to the plane of the sky (90° indicates an edge-on view).

---

### **Physical Parameters**
- **pl_eqt**: Equilibrium temperature of the planet, determined by its distance from the star and the star's luminosity. It assumes no greenhouse effect.
- **pl_rade, pl_radj**: Planetary radius in Earth radii (pl_rade) or Jupiter radii (pl_radj). Larger planets tend to be gas giants, while smaller planets are rocky.
- **pl_bmasse**: Planetary mass in Earth masses, often derived from radial velocity or transit timing observations.
- **pl_dens**: Density of the planet, indicating its composition. High density suggests a rocky composition, while low density points to a gaseous nature.

---

### **Transit Parameters**
- **pl_trandep**: Transit depth, or the fractional decrease in stellar brightness when the planet transits its star. It provides an estimate of the planet's size relative to the star.
- **pl_tranmid**: The mid-point of the transit, usually expressed in Julian Date. This is crucial for timing studies.
- **pl_trandur**: Transit duration, or the time it takes for the planet to completely pass across the stellar disk.

---

### **Stellar Properties**
- **st_teff**: The effective temperature of the star's surface in Kelvin. This determines the star's spectral type (e.g., G-type stars like the Sun have ~5778 K).
- **st_met**: Stellar metallicity, which indicates the abundance of elements heavier than helium. It's often expressed relative to the Sun ([Fe/H]).
- **st_mass, st_rad**: Stellar mass and radius compared to the Sun. These values are critical for calculating planet parameters like orbital distance.
- **st_age**: The estimated age of the star in billions of years (Gyr).

---

### **Kinematics and Parallax**
- **sy_pm, sy_pmra, sy_pmdec**: Proper motion of the star in milliarcseconds per year (mas/yr), showing its movement on the celestial sphere.
- **sy_plx**: Parallax in milliarcseconds, which is inversely proportional to distance. A parallax of 1 mas corresponds to a distance of 1 kiloparsec.
- **sy_dist**: Distance to the star in parsecs. Derived from parallax and crucial for determining absolute stellar and planetary properties.

---

### **Stellar Magnitudes**
- **sy_gmag, sy_gaiamag, sy_tmag**: Stellar magnitudes in specific bands:
  - **Gmag**: From Gaia observations, capturing visible light.
  - **Tmag**: TESS bandpass magnitude, optimized for detecting planetary transits.
- **sy_w1mag, sy_w2mag, ...**: Infrared magnitudes from the WISE telescope, important for studying cooler stars or planetary atmospheres.

---

### **Flags**
- **tran_flag**: Indicates whether the planet was detected via the transit method.
- **rv_flag**: Indicates detection by the radial velocity method.
- **ttv_flag**: Indicates the detection of transit timing variations, often caused by additional planets.

---

### **Notes and Auxiliary Data**
- **pl_nespec, pl_ndispec, pl_ntranspec**: Number of spectra available for the planet, helpful for atmospheric studies or mass-radius relationships.
- **pl_nnotes**: Count of annotations or additional information about the planet.

---

### **Visualization Columns**
- **x, y, z**: 3D Cartesian coordinates, useful for plotting the system in a spatial context.
- **sky_coord.ra, sky_coord.dec**: Right Ascension and Declination for mapping the location on the celestial sphere.
